      i1 <- a1
  omniscient debugging natively supported
  word levels

  standard string type

      works with any expression, takes top of stack for result

    either // or /* */
  special compiler syntax
    literals
      "hello world"     // string
      ^s0 "hello"       // can also derive type from stack type spec
      "hi"              // s0 is default type for literals
      """hi"""          // can use triple quotes also
      'hi'              // can use single quotes as alternative
      '''hi'''          // or triple
      "hi"'"'           // can fuse together multiple literals
      42                // unidentified words that match integers become int literals
      ^i2 42            // size usually comes from type definition
      0x1E              // hex (from multi-words)
      0b10111           // binary
    type casting / definition
      (i1 i1)           // means top of stack has two ints
      ^i1               // means next word produces an i1
      ^(i2 i2)          // means next word produces two i2s
  word definition
    // L3 word: recorded
    : double(i2 -> i2) dup + ;  
    :: L2 word ;;     // restores heap and dictionary on exit
    ::: L1 word ;;;   // minimal lemon word
    :::: L0 word ;;;; // asm word
  scoped variables
    defining a word inside of a word?
    return should revert dictionary 
      but we don't want to add the extra overhead for every word call?
      affect only higher level words
      each word must have a level, and can't call higher levels
      only L2 and L3 words revert
  polymorphism
    runtime type checking?
      only for high level types?
    can only work if we track types at runtime

64 bit word pointers, or not?
  simplicity and debugability is top priority, not memory or performance
  [ ] 64 bit words
      4x bigger block definitions
  [ ] 16 bit words
      much smaller, but requires an additional indirection to execute a word
      but this might be faster anyways since it's more likely to be in a cpus cache
  [*] variable, set in code
      support different settings by loading different interpreters

indirect or direct threading
  [ ] direct is simpler to debug
      faster jumping
      takes more space
  [*] indirect reduces space for almost every word
      3 32 bit words saved for the simplest DOCOL

register variables not supported
and macros are weak
use bash templating instead

word design:
  16 bit word index >word_table> 64 bit word address >
    back link (pointer to previous word)
    forward link (pointer to next word)
    flags (1 byte)
    parsing word
    decompile word
    length (1 byte)
    name (1-256 bytes)
    pad (0-7 bytes)
    codeword 
    16 bit words
    pad (0-7 bytes)

better decompiling support
  since words can contain meta words and not original source
  how to match source with compiled
    reverse compile words
    LIT 0 -> 0
    words will have a reverse compile option to handle this process

decompiling philosophy:
  will not store source
  target code should be the source
  must make target code very easy to understand and navigate to make up for missing source code
  no comments
  example:
    inlining another word
    we want to be able to see that the word was inlined, and want to be able to have a modification to that word also modify the places which were inlined
      to do this, we'd need to track where it came from

get basic forth language working
  conditionals
    if / elif / else / fi
    for / done # combine with while and until?
